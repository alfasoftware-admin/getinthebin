# What?
A fun interactive game to educate Alfa people with what can and cannot be recycled and how!

# Why?
The recycling bins in Moor easily become contaminated with non-recyclables. 
This is likely due to recycling instructions and package labelling being confusing along with recycling rules being inconsistent across services (something you can recycle at home might not be recyclable at the office). 
We see a lot of 'wishful recycling', where someone might chuck their sandwich wrapper in the blue recycling bin, in the hopes that it will be recycled. But in reality, 17% of UK recycling cannot be recycled due to contamination. 

Please rinse recyclable materials to ensure food residue is washed away, and if in doubt, don't contaminate the recycling bin, chuck it into landfill!

# Top Tips for point-scoring...
* If in doubt, chuck into landfill (don't contaminate the recycling bin)
* Don't add dirty recyclables to recycling bin (rinse them first)
* Compostable packaging/cutlery can only be composted under commercial composting conditions (Alfa's Organic waste bins are not commercial composted - i.e. no compostable packaging/cutlery in organic bins)
